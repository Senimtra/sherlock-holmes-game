# Sherlock Holmes Game 🔎

Homage to the old text-adventures - written in Python. ⌨️

## General information 👈

Reason for all of this: I want to improve my Python knowledge. 🐍

The game is intended to be a classic text adventure. The player will be able to move around Victorian London trying to solve a crime (which I have yet to come up with 😉).

I got the idea from the first group project at Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp when we were programming a simple escape-room game in Python. 🚀

As a young child, I played 'Sherlock' (Melbourne House) with my dad on the C64, just text and a few pixelated images - it was great! I also have only good memories of 'Sherlock Holmes and the Serrated Scalpel'. And I saw Jeremy Brett in London as Holmes in the theater then and loved the whole setting of dark, mysterious, Victorian London (BBC Sherlock, From Hell, Jack the Ripper, etc...). 🗡️

Let's see what's going to happen... 🤘

## Tech stack 💻

Honestly, I have no idea what it takes to make a real game in Python. Besides Python, I used PyGame (only to display images, so not at all). So that's how it will start.

- Python
- PyGame

## Project planning 📊

## Game elements 🕹️

- Object-oriented programming
- Images based on location
- 'Experienceable' criminal case (possibly scripted)
- Player inventory
- As much player intervention as possible
- Scalable text parser
- Saved games
- Graphical User Interface (possibly)
- Unified game theme (later on)
